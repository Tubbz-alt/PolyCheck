clang is used by pet to generate isl info 

rose compiler to give isl info for pet

polyopt - extract scop and give isl info

polyopt- generate transformed source


high,mid,low level AST rewrite mechanism - rewrite.h - can we use ?

SageBuilder - the solid, recommended way

TODO:

- Include version information on the written array reference in computing 
  statement instance

- Add support when multiple statements in source programmatch a statement in the
  transformed program

- Add support to properly detect and terminate out of non-terminating 
  transformed programs (that generate operations to be checked).

Not working - do not generate pc_test files:
- adi.c - Error: unable to create pw_aff for dimension 1
- durbin.c - alpha[k] = -sum[k][k] * beta[k]; -> check not inserted, generated ?
- gramschmidt, dynprog, reg_detect, symm:
  - Error: map is not single valued. maynot be convertible to pwaff for dimension 0.

Other errors:
- cholesky.c, ludcmp - double insertions, function call
- correlation.c, floyd-warshall - sqrt, ternary operator
