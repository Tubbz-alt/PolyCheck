clang is used by pet to generate isl info 

ROSE: polyopt - extract scop and give isl info

polyopt- generate transformed source

high,mid,low level AST rewrite mechanism - rewrite.h - can we use ?

SageBuilder - the solid, recommended way

TODO:

- Include version information on the written array reference in computing 
  statement instance -- DONE

- Add support when multiple statements in source programmatch a statement in the
  transformed program

- Add support to properly detect and terminate out of non-terminating 
  transformed programs (that generate operations to be checked).

Not working - do not generate pc_test files:
- adi - Error: unable to create pw_aff for dimension 1
- gramschmidt, symm:
  - Error: map is not single valued. maynot be convertible to pwaff for dimension 0.

dynprog, reg_detect:
- Error: generated epilog has invalid syntax

Other errors:
- cholesky, ludcmp - double insert - manually check if code is valid ?
- correlation: Is the following handled ?
  #define sqrt_of_array_cell(x,j) sqrt(x[j])
  stddev[j] = sqrt_of_array_cell(stddev, j);
