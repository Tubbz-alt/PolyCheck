clang is used by pet to generate isl info 

ROSE: polyopt - extract scop and give isl info

polyopt- generate transformed source

high,mid,low level AST rewrite mechanism - rewrite.h - can we use ?

SageBuilder - the solid, recommended way

TODO:

- Include version information on the written array reference in computing 
  statement instance -- DONE

- Check write version numbers in inline checks as well

- Add support when multiple statements in source program match a statement in the
  transformed program

- Add support to properly detect and terminate out of non-terminating 
  transformed programs (that generate operations to be checked).

- Support for kills to handle intermediate variables (to some extent) 
(needed for cholesky, lu, gramschmidt, symm)

- Ensure variables in polynomial match the loop variables (shows up in epilog of
 x-eliminated cholseky). Need to use preprocessor macros rather than inlining 
 the polynomial expression. -- DONE

Not working - do not generate pc_test files:
- adi - Error: unable to create pw_aff for dimension 1
  -- This seems an ISL bug. Have a minimal test case. Need to Send to Sven.
- gramschmidt, symm:
  - Error: map is not single valued. maynot be convertible to pwaff for dimension 0.

Running the generated code:
 - run fails (assert _diff == 0 failed) - covariance, seidel-2d, correlation, jacobi-1d-imper
- compile errors: 
  cholesky, fdtd-apml, ludcmp - fix double insert, still fails with manual fix
